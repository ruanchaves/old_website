**Abstract:** Word segmentation can contribute to improve the results of natural language processing tasks on several problem domains, including social media sentiment analysis, source code summarization and neural machine translation. Taking the English language as a case study, we fine-tune a Transformer architecture which has been trained through the Pre-trained Distillation (PD) algorithm, while comparing it to previous experiments with recurrent neural networks. We organize datasets and resources from multiple application domains under a unified format, and demonstrate that our proposed architecture has competitive performance and superior cross-domain generalization in comparison with previous approaches for word segmentation in Western languages.
