---

I'm a machine learning engineer with a focus on Natural Language Processing. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I have recently been accepted into the European Master Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT).

In Brazil, I have performed several research projects in artificial intelligence while affiliated with the AI Center of Excellence (CEIA) and the Federal University of Goi√°s. I have also briefly participated in Neuralmind, a leading startup in natural language processing and computer vision.

Prior to my career in Data Science, I spent the first years of my academic journey studying several fields in the Humanities. After switching careers, my lifelong interest in Linguistics has naturally led me to the field of Natural Language Processing.
