Prior to my career in Data Science, I spent the first years of my academic journey studying several fields in the Humanities. I have been through Ancient Greek literature, research projects on historical newspapers -- and even briefly attended Law school! After switching careers, my lifelong interest in Linguistics has naturally led me to the field of Natural Language Processing.

{: .text-justify} Nowadays I see myself as a Machine Learning Engineer: my focus is on writing code and developing practical solutions for startups and companies in NLP and related fields in artificial intelligence.   

{: .text-justify} I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goi√°s (UFG) and I have participated in numerous projects while affiliated with startups and research institutes in Brazil. One of my main achievements during this period was to achieve first place at two NLP competitions in Textual Entailment: [ASSIN 2](https://sites.google.com/view/assin2/english) and [COLIEE 2021](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~rabelo/COLIEE2021/).     

{: .text-justify} After working for two years in Brazil, I moved out of the country after joining the [Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT)](https://lct-master.org/) with an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. I'm currently on my first year at the University of the Basque Country, and the second year will take place at the University of Malta. I'm also a Data Science Intern at Recognai, where I develop [Rubrix](https://www.rubrix.ml/) -- a production-ready Python framework for exploring, annotating, and managing data in NLP projects.
