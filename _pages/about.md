title: "About Me"
---

Prior to my career in Data Science, I spent the first years of my academic journey studying several fields in the Humanities. I have been through Ancient Greek literature, research projects on historical newspapers -- and even briefly attended Law school! After switching careers, my lifelong interest in Linguistics has naturally led me to the field of Natural Language Processing.   

Nowadays, I see myself as a Machine Learning Engineer: my focus is on writing code and developing practical solutions for startups and companies in NLP.    

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goi√°s (UFG), in Brazil. It was the first university in the country to offer an undergraduate program in Artificial Intelligence. Overall, it was a very conducive environment for cutting-edge research in NLP, and I have participated in numerous research projects while affiliated with its AI Center of Excellence (CExIA).     

Aside from private projects developed for third parties, one of my main achievements during this period was to develop a solution that achieved the first place at the ASSIN 2 competition on Textual Entailment. A few months later, during my brief participation in Neuralmind, a leading NLP startup in Brazil, I again achieved first place at COLIEE 2021, a competition on Legal Case Entailment.     

After working for one and a half year in Brazil, I moved out of the country after joining the Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (LCT) with an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. I'm currently on my first year at the University of the Basque Country, and the second year will take place at the University of Malta.   

I'm also a Data Science Intern at Recognai, where I develop Rubrix -- a production-ready Python framework for exploring, annotating, and managing data in NLP projects.
